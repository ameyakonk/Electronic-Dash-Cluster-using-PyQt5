Introduction: Endodontic file is used for Root Canal operations. While performing Root Canal procedure, the doctor may have to continuously keep on changing files of different 
              sizes, in order to perform accurate Root canal operations. The Endodontic file gets deformed if excessive force is put on it. This results into the breakage of file.

Solution: Before using the file, it is scanned to check deformity of the Endodontic file. The scanner capture image of the file and performs edge detection to count the number of 
          edges of the file. An undeformed file has a fixed number of edges which is set as a reference number. When an arbitrary file is scanned and its edges are calculated, 
          these edges are compared with the reference number. If the edges are equal to the reference number, then the file is not deformed and can be used in the Root Canal 
          procedure. If the edges are not equal, then then the file isdeformed and cannot be used in the Root Canal procedure.
